```cpp
int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums)
    {

        int slow = nums[0];
        int fast = nums[0];

        do{
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[nums[fast]];
        }while(slow != fast);

        slow = nums[0];

        while(slow != fast)
        {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[fast];
        }

        return slow;
        
    }
```

1. First solution to make the indices of nums[i] as negative but that will not follow the constraints, of not updating the original array and solve it with O(1) SPACE.
2. We use a do-while loop because slow and fast start at the same position, so we must move them at least once before checking for a meeting point. 🚀


Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
